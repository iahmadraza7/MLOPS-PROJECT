# Project Improvements Summary

The following improvements have been made to meet the MLOps project requirements for the [Mlops-Project](https://github.com/iahmadraza7/Mlops-Project):

## Documentation
- Created comprehensive README.md with project overview, setup instructions, and workflow details
- Added this IMPROVEMENTS.md file to document changes
- Added detailed instructions for running each component of the pipeline
- Added Makefile to simplify common operations

## Infrastructure & DevOps
- Fixed GitHub Actions workflows for linting/testing and CI/CD
- Updated Kubernetes deployment.yaml with environment variable for Docker username
- Enhanced Dockerfile to properly set up the application environment
- Created setup.py script to initialize the project directory structure
- Implemented multi-stage Docker build for reduced image size and better security
- Added .dockerignore file to optimize Docker builds
- Created docker_ops.py helper script for Docker operations
- Added comprehensive docker-compose.yml with services for app, MLflow, and Airflow

## Data Management
- Created dedicated preprocessing script (src/preprocess.py) for data cleaning
- Configured DVC pipeline in dvc.yaml for data versioning and processing
- Updated Airflow DAG to use the preprocessing script and proper task dependencies
- Created sample cricket dataset for demonstration purposes
- Added proper data flow between ETL stages with task context passing

## Model Development
- Added robust MLflow tracking to the model training script
- Created metrics directory and JSON output for model performance tracking
- Fixed file paths in the training script to be consistent across the project
- Added command-line interface for model training and prediction
- Implemented better error handling and logging throughout the codebase

## Testing
- Added unit tests for model prediction functionality
- Added unit tests for data processing functionality
- Updated GitHub Actions workflow to run tests automatically
- Created Docker container test script
- Added proper test fixtures and cleaned up test code

## API & Deployment
- Created Flask API (app.py) to serve model predictions
- Updated Dockerfile to run the Flask API instead of training script
- Added health check endpoint to the API
- Added proper error handling and logging to the API
- Created CLI utility (predict_cli.py) for making predictions
- Enhanced Kubernetes deployment for better reliability

## Dependencies
- Updated requirements.txt with specific versions for all dependencies
- Added missing dependencies for testing and deployment
- Fixed dependency conflicts (Flask version for Airflow compatibility)

## Code Quality
- Implemented consistent code structure across all Python files
- Added proper docstrings and type hints
- Improved error handling and logging
- Added command-line arguments to scripts for flexibility

These improvements ensure that the project follows MLOps best practices and meets all the requirements specified in the project description. The enhanced pipeline now provides a complete end-to-end workflow from data ingestion to model deployment with proper tracking, versioning, and monitoring.
